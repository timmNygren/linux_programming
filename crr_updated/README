Welcome to CRR. This application uses the getdate_r() function.
To start off, make sure you

$> source datemsk.sh

Otherwise you'll have a bad time, and the error.log will tell you anyways.

This is just a basic console application. Implementing curses into my project was taking too much time so I abandoned and
just went with no curses. The frantic rushes from previous "due dates" created some not so great code which made curses porting
very difficult. Signals also were not implemented due to time constraints.

*** NOTES about the rubric
In the rubric, you mention that requirement 3b is for the UI. If you look above at the description, 3c should be the UI. Requirement
3b refers to reading the schedule save file. For this, I use REQ3a, REQ3b, REQ3c. REQ3a and REQ3b are for reading command line args. 
REQ3c is for requirement 3b in the rubric.
